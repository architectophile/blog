### Identity-Based Encryption


### Attribute-Based Encryption

The concept of Attribute-Based Encryption was introduced by Sahai and Waters [34], who also presented a particular scheme that
they called Fuzzy Identity-Based Encryption (FIBE). The Fuzzy-IBE scheme builds upon
several ideas from Identity-Based Encryption [10, 36, 18].

Yao et. al. [19] show how an IBE system that encrypts to multiple hierarchical identities in a collusion-resistant manner implies a forward secure Hierarchical IBE scheme. They also note how their techniques for resisting collusion attacks are useful in attribute-based encryption. However, the cost of their scheme in terms of computation, private key size, and ciphertext size increases exponentially with the number of attributes.

We also note that there has been other work that applied IBE techniques to access control, but did not
address our central concern of resisting attacks from colluding users [37, 14].
