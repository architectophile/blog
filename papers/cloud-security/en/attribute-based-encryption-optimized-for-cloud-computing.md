# Attribute-Based Encryption Optimized for Cloud Computing

## Abstract

Our main result is an extension of the decentralized CP-ABE scheme of Lewko and Waters [LW11] with identity-based user revocation.

Our revocation system is made feasible by removing the computational burden of a revocation event from the cloud service provider, at the expense of some permanent, yet acceptable overhead of the encryption and decryption algorithms run by the users.


## I. Introduction

Attribute-based encryption (ABE) proposed by Sahai and Waters [SW05] is intended for oneto-many encryption in which ciphertexts are encrypted for those who are able to fulfil certain
requirements.
