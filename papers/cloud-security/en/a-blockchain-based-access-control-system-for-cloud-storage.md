# A Blockchain-Based Access Control System for Cloud Storage 

## Abstract

A prototype multi-user system for access control to datasets stored in an untrusted cloud environment  without the provider participation. 

ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption scheme with dynamic attributes.




## I. Introduction

The essential problem is transferring data to the external environment, such that anyone else other than the owner can get access to information.

Encryption is one of the main protective mechanisms recommended by the Cloud Security Alliance.

## II. ACCESS CONTROL SYSTEM

implementation of attribute-based encryption-based Ethereum smart contracts.

The most widely-used standard for attribute-based access control is XACML.

it is necessary to classify them firstly as either publicly available or restricted. To do this, the user must be given the opportunity to convert files and directories with the appropriate attributes.

Thus, in the case of restricted information is required to obtain all necessary encoding information, encryption to send data to the cloud and add an appropriate entry in the blockchain.

Change the virtual machine state can be written in Turing complete scripting language. 

For each file the user creates a smart contract, which will store information about the owner, access policy, a hash sum of the stored information, information to identify the cloud, and all changes that will occur with the file.
