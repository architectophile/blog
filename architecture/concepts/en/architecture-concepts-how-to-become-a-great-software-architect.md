# How to Become a Great Software Architect?

<br/>

## 1. What is Software Architecture?

### 1) Wikipedia

- Software architecture:
  - High level structures
  
- Structure:
  - Software elements +
  - Relations among them +
  - Properties of elements and relations

- Structures + Boxes + Arrows

But does it catch all?

### 2) Architecture Failure?

- The reasons why software doesn't go into production
  - Security problem
  - Compliance problem

- Failure caused by structure?

But the technical problems not seen on the architecture diagram.

Then is this architecture successful?

The definition of software architecture is not enough.

Martin Fowler

Software architecture:
Important and hard to change decisions.

You don't know which decisions are hard to change in advance.


Software architecture:

Find technical solutions to the problem at hand.

Home-grown definition

### How to understand the problem?

Quality Attributes / Tree

- Reliablity
  - Availability
  - Fault Tolerance
  - Recoverability
  - Maturity

  - Non-repudiation
  
- Maintainability


Structure only helps with maintainability
