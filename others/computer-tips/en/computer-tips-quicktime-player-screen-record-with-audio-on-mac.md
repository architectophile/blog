# How To Record Internal Audio with QuickTime Player Screen Recording on macOS

<br/>

## 1. Introduction

When you use `QuickTime Player` for `Screen Recording`, you might expect it to record `internal audio` together at the same time. But it doesn't record internal audio automatically by default while it records your screen. It actually records only your voice through the microphone on your machine. 

If you want it to record internal audio as well, you need to set some special configurations. So in this post, I'm going to show you how to configure the settings on macOS to make `QuickTime Player` record screen alongside internal audio at the same time. 

First, we are going to install `Soundflower` for audio source manipulation, add some sound input/output devices at `Audio Midi Setup`, and then change `Sound` settings to apply the configuration to `QuickTime Player`. So, let's see how to do it step by step.

<br/>

## 2. Soundflower Installation

`Soundflower` is a OS X system extension that allows applications to pass audio to other applications. So we are going to use it to pass our `internal audio` to `QuickTime Player`.

### 1) Go to the link below and download the Soundflower installer

<br/>

### 2) Open the installation package

<br/>

<br/>

When you try to open the package, you might encounter a security warning that states ***\"Soundflower.pkg" can't be opened because it is from an unidentified developer.***

<br/>

In this case, you need to `right-click` the package and go to `Open With > Installer (default)`.

<br/>

<br/>

Then, you will be prompted to allow it to open the package. And click on the `Open` button.

<br/>

### 3) Install Soundflower

Click on the `Continue` button to start the installation.

<br/>

### 4) Unblock installing the package(if the installation is failed)

***If the installation is failed,*** you will see the error message that states ***A program tried to load new system extension(s) signed by "MATT INGALLS".*** It blocked the installation because the signer(MAT INGALLS) of the program is unknown to the system. So, we are going to see how to resolve this issue.  
(But if the installation is ***succeeded***, you can ***just skip*** this step and ***go to step 5).***)
